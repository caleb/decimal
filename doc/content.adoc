== Introduction

_decimal_ is a small and concise library that provides Decimal type for
clojurescript.

[WARNING]
====
This documentation does not covers all api, so if you miss
some function, contributions are very welcome. You can see the full
link:api/index.html#id[API documentation here].
====


=== Project Maturity

Since _decimal_ is a young project there can be some API breakage.


=== Install

The simplest way to use _decimal_ in a clojurescript project, is by including
it in the dependency vector on your *_project.clj_* file:

[source,clojure]
----
[funcool/decimal "1.0.0"]
----

== Use

To start using it you have to require the `decimal.core` namespace.

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[decimal.core :as dc])
----

It accepts a value of type number, string or Decimal.

[source, clojure]
----
(let [x (dc/decimal 123.4567)
	  y (dc/decimal "123456.7e-3")
	  z (dc/decimal x)]
  (dc/= x y z))
----

A value can also be in binary, hexadecimal or octal if the appropriate prefix
is included.

[source, clojure]
----
(let [x (dc/decimal "0xff.f")
	  y (dc/decimal "0b10101100")
	  z (dc/+ x y)]
  (dc/to-binary z)     ;; "0b110101011.1111"
  (dc/to-binary z 13)) ;; "0b1.101010111111p+8"
----

The methods that return a Decimal can be chained.

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dc/decimal 11)
    (dc/div 2)
    (dc/mul 9)
    (dc/floor)) ;; #decimal 49
----

Almost all of the methods of JavaScript's Math object are also replicated.

[source, clojure]
----
(dc/sqrt "6.98372465832e+9823")     ;; #decimal 8.3568682281821340204e+4911
(dc/pow 2 0.0979843)                ;; #decimal 1.0702770511687781839
----

There are `NaN?` and `finite?` methods, as `NaN` and `Infinity` are valid `Decimal` values,

[source, clojure]
----
(dc/NaN? (dc/decimal js/NaN)) ;; true
(dc/finite? (dc/decimal js/Infinity)) ;; false
----

and a `to-fraction` method with an optional maximum denominator argument

[source, clojure]
----
(let [pi (dc/div (dc/decimal 355) 113)]
  (dc/to-fraction pi)         ;; [#decimal 31415929203539823009 #decimal 10000000000000000000]
  (dc/to-fraction pi 1000))   ;; [#decimal 355 #decimal 113]
----

All calculations are rounded according to the number of significant digits and
rounding mode specified by the precision and rounding properties of the Decimal
constructor.

Multiple Decimal constructors can be created, each with their own independent
configuration which applies to all Decimal numbers created from it.

[source, clojure]
----
;; Set the precision and rounding of the default Decimal constructor
(dc/config! {:precision 5 :rounding :round-half-up})

;; Create another Decimal constructor, optionally passing in a configuration object
(let [decimal10 (dc/config {:precision 10 :rounding :round-down})
      x (dc/decimal 5)
      y (decimal10 5)]
  (dc/div x 3)     ;; #decimal 1.6667
  (dc/div y 3))    ;; #decimal 1.666666666
----

== Developers Guide

=== Philosophy

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _decimal_ should keep these important rules in mind.


=== Contributing

Unlike Clojure and other Clojure contributed libraries _decimal_ does not have many
restrictions for contributions. Just open an issue or pull request.


=== Source Code

_decimal_ is open source and can be found on
link:https://github.com/funcool/decimal[github].

You can clone the public repository with this command:

[source,text]
----
git clone https://github.com/funcool/decimal

=== Run tests

For running tests just execute this:

.ClojureScript
[source, shell]
----
./scrpts/build
node ./out/tests.js
